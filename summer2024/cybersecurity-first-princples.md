# Chapter 1: First Principles
- The absolute cybersecurity first principle was to build a completely secure computer. While this can be done, it means that nothing useful can be done on it.

The idea of first principles was introduced by Aristotle in his works. Descartes, history's most famous doubter made official the term 'first principles', with the idea 'I think therefore I am.'
- To solve a complex problem, it must be reduced to it's simplest form.
- First principles in a designated problem space are extremely elementary.
- So, what are cybersecurity's first principles?

- Defense in Depth is a common cybersecurity model first described by Dr. Fred Cohen.
- Tools that are added to the _security stack_ are intrusion detection, antivirus and that sort of thing.
- If one line fails, the next would take over. This is the fundamental principle of Defense in Depth.
- Protecting cloud assets has become more difficult as so-called data islands have formed.

- Seeley's cybersecurity principles are:
- "Complete knowledge of a system is unobtainable; therefore uncertainty will always exist in our understanding of that system."
- "The principal of a system must invest trust in one or more agents."
- "Known risks can be mitigated using controls, transferrence, and avoidance, else the risks must be accepted."
- "Unknown risks manifest through complexity."

- The CIA represents the three pillars of information security.
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

The fundamental proposal for the ultimate goal of cybersecurity in this book is:
"Reduce the probability of material impact due to a cyber event over the next three years."
